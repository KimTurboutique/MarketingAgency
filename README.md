## Marketing Agency

This project was done for the Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge. For a marketing company "Horiseon". The project was done with a starter code, that was improvised using:

* Code Refactoring- replacing non-semantic HTML tags with semantic HTML- using HTML 5 best practices.
* DRY CSS practices- limiting repetitive CSS properties by adding class selectors and consolidating the elements that share the same properties. 

Implementing these steps provided accesibility to the webpage to meet SEO standards. Accessibility was tested using Lighthouse via Chrome Inspector.
