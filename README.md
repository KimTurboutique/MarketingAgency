## Marketing Agency

This project was done for the Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge. For a marketing company "Horiseon". The project was done with a started code, that was improvised using:

* Code Refactoring
* Semantic HTML elements
* DRY CSS practices

Implementing these steps provided accesibility to the webpage. Accessibility was tested using Lighthouse via Chrome Inspector.
